### Project Overview

- **My role**: Product manager, UX researcher
- **Highlights**:
  - This project is a real case cooperating with a Taiwanese hospital. I had to find a balance between clients' expectation and the hospital's space constraints, designing the new service flow and evaluaiton methods in a limited schedule.
- **Project time**: 2021 June ~ 2021 Sep; 2022 May~2022 June, 6 months in total.<br/> (Since Covid-19, the field study stopped for half a year.)

### Challenges

- #### Doctors are overwhelmed with too many patients and paper work

  VGH is a first-class medical center in Taipei, Taiwan. <ins>An anesthesiologist takes care of 50 ~ 80 clinic patients for preanesthetic assessment in three hours on average, which means a doctor has to finish a checkup per patient in 2.5 minutes.</ins>

  What's more, since the preanesthetic assessment documentation hasn't been digitalized, doctors have to quickly record as they speak to the patient, which leads to patients' dissatisfaction, regarding doctors being inconsiderate.

- #### Patients burn out with long waits and short appointment
  Due to the overloading patient numbers,<ins> each patient should wait for 40 minutes to 1 hour, but take the assessment shortly, leading to patients' complaints.</ins>

---

### User Research

To investigate the current workflow in hospital, <ins>I invited doctors who participated in this project and our colleagues who have done the assessment in this hospital</ins>. Click the tab to see more research details.

#### From doctors' side

- **Objectives**: (1)Understand assessment flow and (2)collect the questions that doctors usually ask.
- **Methods**: Phone and in-person interview with eight anesthesiologists, each one with 15~20 minutes.
- **Selected interview questions**:
  - What and how do you usually ask patients based on the assessment form?
  - What usually takes you the most time in the assessment?
- **Doctors' task analysis**: <br/>
  Based on the interview, <ins>I visualized doctor's assessment workflow chart as below</ins>. Task 3 is the routin assessment QA that doctors agreed that it can be asked first by the service robot.

#### From patients' side

- **Objectives**: (1)Understand appointment flow and (2)explore what different types of patients care about.
- **Methods**: In-person interview with staff in hospital and two of my colleagues with preanesthetic assessment experience in that hospital.
- **Selected interview questions**:
  - Share your experience of going to the preanesthetic assessment.
  - What do you think important in the assessment?
- **Patients' task analysis**:<br/>
  After visualizing patients' appointment workflow as the chart below, I found that task 4 and task 5 were two steps where Zenbo could provide assistance.

- **Three types of patients**: From user interviews, field observation, and collecting experience from hospital staff, I summarized three types of patients according to their health status - (1) the middle-aged with potential cancer risk, (2) the middle-aged with controllable cancer and requires periodical checkups, (3) elderly with complex conditions. <ins>Since the robot's dialogue engine was designed to recognize Chinese, we excluded patient type 3 out of our first target audience in this project.</ins>

#### Research Take-away

To clarify what features should be considered in my design, I listed what each stakeholder emphasized. The stakeholders include patients, anesthesiologists, and the director of the anesthesiology department.

| Stakeholders       | Patient                                                      | Doctor                                                                    | Hospital director                        |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Demographics**   | Age: 30~65,<br/>90% for painless gastroscopy checkups        | Mostly are resident doctors                                               | Experienced visiting staff               |
| **What they care** | \*Efficient assessment<br/> <ins>Customized assessment</ins> | <ins>Efficient patient filtering</ins>,<br/>More time on complex patients | <ins>Medical record digitalization</ins> |

\*It's interesting that patient didn't expect 'longer' assessment, but more 'efficient' process, which included answering the routin questions while they were waiting.

### Problem statement

Through the user interview, I narrowed down the problems into three:

1. How to reduce patients' unsatisfaction while waiting?
2. How to help doctors focus on complex patients?
3. How to seemlessly store the assessment results into the hospital system?

### Design process

Based on the user research, I moved on to three design phases. Click each tab to see more details.

<Tab name="Phase 1">

### Phase 1: Role & Function Design

In this project we used ASUS service robot, [Zenbo Junior](https://zenbo.asus.com/product/zenbojuniorii/overview/), as the intervention. <ins>Zenbo features its conversational engine, so I proposed Zenbo could either play as a doctor or an assistant; however, after discussing with our hospital client, due to medical legistration concerns, Zenbo should be an assistant that doesn't provide prescription.</ins>

The main task of Zenbo is to ask the routine 12 medical history questions, and the human doctors would focus on explaining anesthetic risks. In terms of facial expression, since most of patients are middle-age adults, I selected a friendly smily face, and a professional female tone as the robot's voice, as shown below.

### Phase 2: Human-Robot Cooperation Flow Design

How to embed Zenbo in the current assessment workflow is one of the challenging part in this project. After user interviews, I drew a storyboard to help our in-house teams understand the clinic environment, as shown in the below left hand picture.

Considering Zenbo's voice recognition quality and patients' privacy, I suggested placing Zenbo in an individual room. After several times of negociation, the hospital staff and I designed a service flow that can make Zenbo's room closer to the clinic, as shown in the below right picture.

<Tab name="Phase 3">

### Phase 3: Dialogue Flow Design

Based on the current assessment questionnarie, I interviewed eight anesthesiologists how they ask patients their medical history, and finally summarized the questions into a flow.

![Artboard 2_2](/images/Zenbo-4.png)

### Dialogue fluency test

To verify the user experience of the dialogue design at a low cost, <ins>I recruited four colleagues who have experienced pre-anesthesia checkups in that hospital to join the Wizard of OZ test. I invited colleagues to speed up our dailogue flow test and make adjustment quickly.</ins>

- **Objective**: Detect bugs in the first dialogue design
- **Method**: Online meeting
- **Tool**: Azure TTS (Text to Speech)
- **Post-test**: Patient emotion test (reference)

![Artboard 11](/images/Zenbo-9.png)

From the pilot study, participants indicated that the robot didn’t have follow-up questions, which seemed purposeful.<ins>According to the feedback, I added the ‘Skip Logic Design’. Under this structure, when a patient said he/she has diabetes, the robot can jump to related follow-up questions.</ins>

The wizard of OZ test also helps strengthen the error handling mechanism - if the robot cannot understand the patient's answer, it will ask again in another way, but if the robot still cannot get the answer after three times, the robot will leave the answer blank with a mark, and this question will be asked by the human doctor.

### Evaluation

The main purpose of the field study is to investigate whether the robot-assisted assessment can improve patients' satisfaction. <ins>After reading [Hepner et al.'s study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15041606/), I designed a between-subject experiment.</ins> The participants were randomly assigned into two groups - the robot-assisted group or the control group.<ins> The advantage of experiment is that it's clear to provide insights for hospital directors to compare before-after difference.</ins>

However, due to Covid-19, we didn't achieve the expected numbers of participants, which should be 30 people per group. Only 27 patients were recruited in total. 16 participants were interviewed by Zenbo and a real doctor, and 11 participants were control group who were interviewed by the doctor.

After the experiment, I interviewed the robot-assisted group about their interaction with the robot.

### Results

Since the number of participants <ins>hasn't reached statistic significance, I adopted descriptive analysis and explored more insights from user interviews.</ins>

#### Descriptive analysis

The robot-assited group spent 2'56 minutes for assessment on average, which was more than the control group by almost 1 minute. This was caused by longer medical history interview by Zenbo, which took almost 2 minutes. Though the robot-assisted group got a bit lower average satisfaction than the control group, the score is still high with 4.56 out of 5.

The result indicates a positive sign of using robot in the clinic. <ins>Patients were served for longer time on personal medical history interview with the robot, and still remained highly satisfied</ins>.

![Artboard 11_2](/images/Zenbo-11.png)

#### Qualitative analysis

From the user interview, I summarized the following insights:

1. **Patients are more willing to speak more with the robot.**

   > I think I talked more to Zenbo. <ins> Because it is a robot, I felt relaxed to share </ins> (my medical history).(Female, aged 42, patient type 2).

2. **Doctors can ask more detailed based on Zenbo's assessment.**

   > One patient has hyperthyroidism, and <ins>because Zenbo's assessment record mentioned it, so I can directly ask more detailed about the patient's current situation.</ins> (Dr. Ke)

3. **Patients were concerned whether Zenbo understood their answer.**

   > In the question about smoking habit, I answered "No" for three times, but <ins>the robot kept asking again. I was confused until it moved on to the next question.</ins> I wonder whether he could understand or not.(Male, Aged 57, patient type 1)

---

### Reflections & Next step

From the result, both patients and doctors revealed positive feedback to Zenbo's assistance. I am also impressed that Zenbo's cuteness can ease patients' uncertainty and make them willing to talk more. However, <ins>this time we only recruited 27 participants, so it still requires further investigation whether Zenbo brings effective help.</ins>

Technically, Zenbo's voice recognition also causes users confusion and disbelief when it cannot identify their words correctly. <ins>The current error handling is to repeat the questions in different ways again, but it also arouses patients' impatience. As a result, next step, I will focus on the error-handling design for lost answers.</ins>
