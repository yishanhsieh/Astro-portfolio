### Project Overview

- **My role**: Designer & Developer
- **Highlights**: I redesigned the responsive blog based on a blog template that doesn't support responsive design. I modified the CSS to make the site personalized and supports desktop, mobile, and tablet size.

- **Project time**: 2023 Nov 10 ~ 2023 Nov 25
- **Demo site**: [here](https://drab-teal-swordfish-tam.cyclic.app/)

### Motivation

My website is previously hosted on WordPress, but since the subscription for customization is getting expensive, I would like to rebuild my website by coding myself. This blog is built for recording my learning in data visualization and UIUX design.

### Responsive Design

The new website is inspired by the talented programmers who share their open source portfolio on [uses.tech](https://uses.tech/like/JavaScript).

To make the blog readable and clear, I chose basic color as the main color with two hightlight colors. As for font, to deliver the sense of relaxation, I chose Quicksand as the heading and body font.

#### Homepage

The hero section features the topic of this blog, which are about data visualization adn user experience. The background is image with star-like dots and a planet with my profile picture. This design derives from the imagination that data is similar to data, conneting to each other like a star sign.

#### About page

The about page features the picture wall on the right hand side. To make the mobile version readable, I adjusted the photos to be vertically center aligned.

#### Articles

To manage the blog posts easier, I made the blog post support markdown format. The font size of the article in the mobile screen is enlarged to make it easier to read.

### Web development

The codebase of my new website derives from [Raddy](https://github.com/RaddyTheBrand/25.NodeJs-Express-EJS-MongoDB--Blog) and [Web Dev Simplified](https://github.com/WebDevSimplified/Markdown-Blog). Both of them separated front-end and back-end by Express, EJS, and MongoDB. The benefits are that our articles are privately stored in DB, and you can log in admin to add posts by an user interface. I combined the two source code, so the system supports markdown, which makes it easier to style the blog content.
