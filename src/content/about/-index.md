I always like to try new things. I self-learn coding, design, public speaking, and skateboarding in my free time. 2023 is a big pivot for me. I quit my job in Taiwan, and flew 7,676 miles to Indiana, the United States, to pursue my study abroad dream.

In my previous job as a sales product manager in [ASUS](https://www.asus.com/), I was mainly responsible for healthcare innovation business. Everyday I was bombarded with questions like how to deliver health-related data and information clearly for doctors and patients, which triggered me to pick up data visualization and UX design as my specialization.

I earned my bachelor and master degree in Library and information science at [National Taiwan University](https://www.ntu.edu.tw/english/), where I picked up UX research skills and gained the opportunity to visit [San Francisco Public Library](https://sfpl.org/) as an observational student.

Nice to meet youðŸ˜Š.
