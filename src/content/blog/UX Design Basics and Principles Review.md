Interaction Design Foundation (IDF) provides free eBook – [The Basics of User Experience Design](https://www.amazon.com/Basics-User-Experience-Design-Interaction-ebook/dp/B07CZB457F), which introduces core concepts about user experience in a simple and clear description. After working in the tech industry for several years, it’s helpful to review the UX principles. This article combines IDF’s material and [7 fundamental UX design principles all designers should know](https://www.uxdesigninstitute.com/blog/ux-design-principles/) by UX Design Institute, listing the key points and examples of 7 UX design principles.

### What’s UX Design?

I like the definition by the UX Design Institute, which indicates that “UX design is the <ins>process</ins> of creating <ins>products and services</ins> that solve a <ins>specific user problem</ins> while ensuring that the proposed solution is both <ins>easy and enjoyable</ins> to use.” Though not necessarily “enjoyable”, <ins>UX design is indeed a “process”, an iterative, non-sequential process.</ins>

### UX Design Process

UX design process is known for [the five phases of design thinking by Stanford D-school](https://web.stanford.edu/~mshanks/MichaelShanks/files/509554.pdf).

### A story of truck stuck under a bridge

Typically, to innovate something, we usually say we should “jump out of the box” and avoid getting trapped into rooted expertise viewpoints. I like a story by IDF about thinking differently.

A truck overloaded with groceries ran under a bridge, but the goods were too high to pass the bridge so the truck got stuck beneath the bridge. When transportation officials and engineers were discussing whether to dismantle parts of the bridge or the truck, a boy walking by said, “Why not leak the air in the wheel tire?” The experts were surprised at this solution and ceased the emergency.

Yeah, the story sounds tricky, but <ins>it reflects the importance of being a freshman like a child when thinking about solutions.</ins>

### 7 UX Principles

IDF and UX Design Institute both provide 7 UX design principles, most of which are overlapped. Here I summarized the principles based on IDF’s materials because they are exclusive.

According to IDF, the 7 UX principles include being useful, usable, findable, credible, desirable, accessible, and valuable, shown as in the infographic below.

### Reflections

User-centered design is one of the most popular UX methodologies and we know the core behind is to stand in users’ shoes. However, users' needs are unlimited and a product cannot fulfill everyone. <ins>The most challenging UX research task for me is not exploring user needs, but narrowing down what matters and prioritizing the problems that need solving.</ins>

My previous supervisor emphasized user experience, but our product still didn’t sell well, and our product team was in an unstable status with a high resignation rate. I found the problem lay in the outspread user research. For example, she required product managers to list all the user scenarios in Excel. Once my colleague listed 5 main scenarios for 5 users, my supervisor disapproved the work, requesting that PM list even more. 10? Not enough. 20? Not enough. My supervisor expected to see how **EVERY** individual may use our product in their life. That was insane. <ins>The unnecessarily complicated user research lengthened the product development circle; moreover, it diminished the teams’ motivation and passion.</ins>

UX principles are a product design reference for product managers and designers. <ins>It’s a way of avoiding designing something stupid and only discovering that dumbness on user testing.</ins> There are lots of features we can self-reflect in the design phases. UX principles should be a guideline that prevent us going in an obvious wrong way. I wish I would keep the principles in mind, as a mind model.

Thanks for reading. Next article, I will summarize the 5 usability principles mentioned by IDF. See you next article.
